Ah, good question — you want the “wizards of ANSI”, programs that go beyond echo -e hacks and actually live inside the terminal’s escape codes. Some are utilitarian (htop), some playful (sl), some outright absurd.

Here’s a map of the territory:

📊 System / Monitoring Tools

These are the “serious” ones, but they’re basically ncurses magic shows:

htop — classic interactive process viewer, colored bars, scrollable, resizable.

gotop / btop++ — like htop on steroids: live graphs, CPU core heatmaps, rainbow bars.

glances — dashboard that crams CPU, RAM, network, processes into one ncurses UI.

bpytop (Python) / bashtop (pure bash!) — smooth animations, bar charts.

nvtop — GPU monitoring, same style as htop, but for NVIDIA/AMD GPUs.

ctop — Docker container htop.

All of these depend on alternate screen buffers, cursor addressing, and live redraws, exactly the tricks we demoed.

🎮 Fun / Toy Programs

These are the “ASCII carnival rides”:

sl — “Steam Locomotive.” Mistype ls? You get a choo-choo train across your screen.

cmatrix — falling green glyphs from The Matrix, infinite rain.

cacafire — burning fire effect in ASCII (part of libcaca).

pipes.sh — endless animated pipes, random colors, like a screensaver.

bb — insane ASCII movie player (Star Wars + demos), runs a whole show inside terminal.

asciiquarium — fish tank in ASCII, with bubbles, fish, sharks, treasure chests.

nyancat — animated rainbow poptart cat flying across terminal.

cbonsai — grows a bonsai tree in ASCII art.

📺 Retro/Media Experiments

aafire / cacafire — realtime ASCII flame effects.

mpv + --vo=tct — watch a video in ASCII directly in terminal.

telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl — plays Star Wars IV in ASCII over telnet.

asciiville — whole desktop-like environment inside a terminal.

🎨 Artistic / Novelty

toilet or figlet — big ASCII banners with fonts.

boxes — draw decorative boxes around text.

lolcat — rainbow colorizes any piped text (uses ANSI 256).

jp2a — convert images to ASCII art.

chafa — advanced image-to-ANSI art, even supports 24-bit colors.

🌀 Extreme Geekery

radare2 / gdb-dashboard — full-on debugging dashboards inside the terminal.

vim / neovim — text editors, but really: they’re terminal window managers in disguise.

ranger — file manager with previews, interactive.

midnight commander (mc) — the original ncurses file manager.

tetris clones (like bastet) — because of course someone wrote Tetris in curses.

The fun paradox

All of them rely on exactly what you’ve been playing with:

secondary screen buffers (?1049h) so they can take over and exit cleanly,

cursor positioning (\e[row;colH) so they can redraw anywhere,

colors (256 / truecolor) for flair,

sometimes even alternate fonts (with Nerd Fonts / Powerline glyphs).

⚡ My personal “best-of” demo lineup if you want to wow yourself in Termux:

pkg install cmatrix sl cacafire boxes figlet toilet lolcat nyancat 

then just run them one by one.

Want me to put together a demo launcher script (ansi_fun.sh) that lets you choose (menu-style) between cmatrix, pipes, fire, nyancat, etc., all from one colorful ncurses menu — like your own little “Terminal Arcade”?
