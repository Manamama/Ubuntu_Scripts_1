: ' Tips:

- **SSH Connection**: When forwarding the ports for the SSH connection and starting the SSHD server on Android, ensure that the specific user (u0_a278) has the necessary permissions to run the 'sshd' command. The password must be set by the 'passwd' command in Termux. On Android openssh must have been installed, keys generated, and password generated for the Termux process user via 'passwd'.

‚ö†Ô∏è Do **not** start the `sshd` process from a Magisk context (e.g., via `su` or boot scripts). 
If `sshd` is launched from Magisk, it will inherit the `u:r:magisk:s0` SELinux domain. This **breaks access to shared storage paths** like `/storage/emulated/0/` and `/storage/sdcard1/`, because Android restricts access to those paths to apps running in the `untrusted_app` context with proper permissions. Use `sudo pkill sshd` then, and start `sshd` from Termux itself (e.g. restart it).  

‚úîÔ∏è Always start `sshd` from within a GUI-launched Termux session to ensure it runs under the `u:r:untrusted_app_*` context, which allows normal storage access.

To verify the SELinux context in your SSH session:
    ps -p $$ -o pid,uid,context

You should see: `u:r:untrusted_app_xx:s0:...` ‚Äî if it says `u:r:magisk:s0`, your storage access will fail.




- **ADB Connection**:
-- The 'getprop persist.sys.usb.config' command can help verify if USB is connected.
-- If no Android device is detected or if it is offline, for adb method, ensure 'USB debugging' is enabled in Developer Options, or consider using WADB on Android. 

-- Even if you connect to Termux via adb, your process user will be different from the Termux on Android. In practice, you will not have access to files in e.g. /storage, as they had been granted to the "real" Termux app user only. You must use the root account for such access then or connect via the ssh way.


- **Root Access**: If the device is not rooted, consider using a workaround like the termux-adb launcher.

- The adbd daemon is run via /apex/com.android.adbd/bin/adbd on Android. You can access it via:

adb -s ZHE6ORBQ7TR8BQHM -d shell  su -c "/apex/com.android.adbd/bin/adbd"


If you want to restart the adbd process, you would typically stop the existing process before starting a new one. This can be done using the setprop command to send a property change to the Android init system, which controls the adbd service1. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

adb shell 'setprop ctl.restart adbd'

- You can use "adb tcpip 5555" to switch , but not needed. 

- Try 
 su -p -c "/apex/com.android.adbd/bin/adbd"
 
 or with sudo, but with 
 unset LD_PRELOAD
 first , 
 
on Droid to check the daemon state. 






'



: ' What the script does:
Define Helper Functions: The script defines several helper functions to retrieve the transport ID of the connected device, identify the Termux user on a selected device, scan a specified IP address and port using nmap, and get the default gateway IP addresses.
Start Main Script: The script begins by displaying a start message and the WiFi Access Point the PC is connected to.
#Set ADB to TCP/IP Mode: The script runs adb tcpip 5555 to set the ADB daemon on the selected device to listen for connections over TCP/IP.
Identify Gateways: The script identifies all gateways and attempts to connect to each gateway using ADB.
Attempt SSH Connection: For each gateway, the script attempts an SSH connection.
Plan B for SSH Connection: The script includes a commented-out section (Plan B) for establishing an SSH connection using ADB to forward a local port to a remote port.
ADB Connection Attempts: The script attempts to connect to each IP address in $ip_address using ADB.
List ADB Connected Devices: The script lists all the ADB connected Android devices.
User Input for Device Selection: The script prompts the user to enter the number of the device they want to connect to.
Termux User Connection via ADB: The script attempts to connect to the selected device via ADB (not SSH). It identifies the Termux user on the selected device and checks if the username is empty.
Starting ADB Shell Session: The script starts an ADB shell session, which opens an interactive shell session on the Android device, allowing the user to manually enter commands.
