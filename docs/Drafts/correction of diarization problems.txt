## Instructions for AI: Correcting Mistagged Speakers Using Transcript Context

Goal:
Identify and propose corrections for mistagged speaker IDs in WhisperX output without access to audio or video, relying solely on textual and contextual cues.

1. Input

JSON/SRT with:

Speaker IDs

Timestamps (objective, must not be changed)

Transcribed text

2. Detect Potential Mistagging

Analyze linguistic patterns per speaker:

Pronouns, gendered language, common roles (e.g., husband/wife, teacher/student)

Lexical style, recurring phrases, vocabulary similarity

Look for contextual inconsistencies:

A segment assigned to Speaker #3 uses patterns or pronouns consistent with Speaker #1 or #2.

Segments that are out-of-turn in dialogue structure (e.g., a “wife” speaking tagged as a new speaker in a sequence dominated by husband/wife).

3. Clustering / Candidate Mapping

Cluster segments across all chunks using:

Textual similarity

Dialogue roles inferred from pronouns and context

Generate candidate merges: identify ghost speakers whose text content is indistinguishable from a known speaker.

4. Propose Corrections to User

For each candidate ghost speaker:

Present the AI’s proposed mapping: “Segment(s) currently tagged as Speaker #3 appear to belong to Speaker #2.”

Ask for user confirmation: e.g., “Is this correct?”

Do not modify timestamps; only propose speaker ID reassignment.

5. Output

Corrected speaker tags (JSON/SRT) after user verification

Mark segments that were proposed for reassignment for auditing

6. Conceptual Notes

Why it works:

AI leverages symbolic reasoning over text, including role, pronoun usage, and context.

Analogous to how we infer intent from circumlocutions or repeated synonyms in voice-to-text.

AI operates only on shadows of reality (transcripts, tags, timestamps) but can approximate the real speaker distribution.

Constraints:

Timestamps are immutable.

No listening or watching — reasoning is purely textual.

Human verification is necessary because AI cannot perceive nuances in tone, pauses, or nonverbal cues.
